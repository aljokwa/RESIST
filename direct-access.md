# Direct Access to Underground Resistance App

Since you're having trouble with the QR code, here's an alternative approach:

## Option 1: Open the HTML file directly

1. Find the `index.html` file on your computer
2. Double click it to open in your browser
3. The app will now load and you can click the "RESIST" button

## Option 2: Deploy to a free hosting service

1. Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2. Drag and drop the `index.html` file from your computer to the browser
3. Wait a few seconds for deployment
4. Netlify will give you a unique URL (like https://random-name-123abc.netlify.app)
5. Open this URL on your mobile device
6. Click the "RESIST" button to be redirected to Detroit techno music

## Option 3: Use a simple local server

If you have Python installed:

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the directory containing index.html:
   ```
   cd /path/to/underground-resistance/app
   ```
3. Run a simple HTTP server:
   ```
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
4. On the same network, access from your mobile device:
   ```
   http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP_ADDRESS:8000
   ```
